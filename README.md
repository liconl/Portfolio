## Cloning:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` followed by `npm start`

###### Note that react-three-fiber and drie have been deprecated, but they have been replaced with @react-three-fiber and @drie (cloning should still work)

### Feel free to look at the live website: https://luis-angel-licon.web.app/ and look at my other projects.
